# NotifyBot
Bot for Azure Botframework that notify clients about events etc.

This Bot service was made during the Freiburg Hackathon 2018 as part of the [Find my Bike Project](https://sbamueller.wordpress.com/2018/06/24/build-your-own-bike-tracker-with-ttn/).

Currently it is under refactoring to work as an abstraction layer for bots mainly work as notifier for clients.
